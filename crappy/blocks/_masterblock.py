  This represent a Crappy block, it must be parent of all the blocks.
  Methods:
    main()
      It must not take any arg, it is where you define the main loop of the block
      If not overriden, will raise an error

    add_[in/out]put(Link object)
      Add a link as [in/out]put

    prepare()
      This method will be called inside the new process but before actually starting the main loop of the program
      Use it for all the tasks to be done before starting the main loop (can be empty)
    start()
      This is the same start method as Process.start: it starts the process, so the initialization (defined in prepare method) will be done, but NOT the main loop

    launch(t0)
      Once the process is started, calling launch will set the starting time and actually start the main method.
      If the block was not started yet, it will be done automatically.
      t0: time to set as starting time of the block (mandatory) (in seconds after epoch)

    status
      Property that can be accessed both in the process or from the parent
        "idle": Block not started yet
        "initializing": start was called and prepare is not over yet
        "ready": prepare is over, waiting to start main by calling launch
        "running": main is running
        "done": main is over
        start and launch method will return instantly
