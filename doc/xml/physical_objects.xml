</para><para>In Crappy, the sensors represent everything that can <bold>acquire</bold> a physical signal. It can be an acquisition card, but also a camera, a thermocouple...</para><para><heading level="2">Actuators </heading>
</para><para>on the other hand, actuators represent all the objects that can <bold>interact on the other part of the test</bold>, and can be controled. The most common example are motors.</para><para><heading level="2">Technicals </heading>
</para><para>Some hardware is <bold>both a sensor and an actuator</bold> by our definitions. This is for example the case of a variable-frequency drive : they can set the speed of the motor (the <emphasis>actuator</emphasis> part), but most of them can also read the position or the speed of the motor the <emphasis>sensor</emphasis> part). </para>    </detaileddescription>
