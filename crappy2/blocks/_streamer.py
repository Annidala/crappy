        PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

        This block does the time vector reconstruction, then assemble it with the results matrix read from the
        LJM Buffer. You have to make sure the computer you run the program on has enough computing power to create
        the time vector of length = scan_rate in less than 1 second. Otherwise the LJM_Buffer will fill endlessly...
