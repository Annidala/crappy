<para>With the Blocks and Links, we already have a working framework to design and custom tests. But if you need to do something slightly different than what is implemented in the Blocks, you have to re-write the whole thing.</para><para>To bring some flexibility to the whole system, we added conditions. They are small classes, implemented by the user, and they are added on the links. A link paired with a condition won&apos;t simply transfer data, but transfer the result of the data passed by the condition. That mean almost infinite possibilites :</para><para><itemizedlist>
