# Crappy is based on a schematic architecture with single blocks linked between each others.
# blocks are the part that do and the Links are the parts that carry informations between these blocks.
#
# Blocks are classes, running indefinitely in a single process.
# Some of them are already implemented (see the reference manual),
# but you can also implement your own.
