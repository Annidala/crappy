What is Crappy ?
==============

CRAPPY is an acronym and stands for Command and Real-time Acquisition in 
Parallelized PYthon.

Crappy was first developped in the "Laboratoire de MÃ©canique de Lille", a 
mechanical research laboratory base in Lille,France, to provide a powerful 
and easy-to-use framework for material testing.

In order to better understand the mechanical behaviour of materials, we tend
to setup tests, with more sensors, more precision and more complexity.
As we are one step before industrials, the testing machines we can buy are not
adapted to our objectives and we have to develop our own softwares to improve
our tests.

This is the original reason why we created Crappy : provide a framework to 
control our tests and all of our hardware.

To this end, we made some choice that are now the keys of the framework:

- **open-source** : it is important for us that everyone can use our work, 
and bring is own code to the world.
    
- **modular** : the hardware as to be, as much as possible, separated from the
software, to provide re-usable code for different setup.
    
- **simple** : Python as been chosen for its good performance and its high 
level. We are not developpers, and our users neither, so we can't afford
a low level programming language. We work with typical loop time of more 
than 1 millisecond (10ms most of the time), and Python is enough for this.
It is also pretty easy to put a small piece of C/C++ in the Python if we 
need a speedup.

- **performance** : a great deal of work is made to ensure the performance of 
the framework. Most tests requires a good repetablilty and a stability,
and may become hazardous in case of not-handled issue.

- **parallelization** : the key to a good test is the synchronisation between
the different sensors. Thsi is why we chose to massively parallelize our
framework, to ensure everything can run at the same time. This is also one
of the major difficulties we have to deal with in Python.
