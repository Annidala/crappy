/*! \mainpage  What is Crappy ?

CRAPPY is an acronym and stands for Command and Real-time Acquisition in 
Parallelized PYthon.

Crappy was first developped in the "Laboratoire de MÃ©canique de Lille", a 
mechanical research laboratory base in Lille,France, to provide a powerful 
and easy-to-use framework for material testing.

In order to better understand the mechanical behaviour of materials, we tend
to setup tests, with more sensors, more precision and more complexity.
As we are one step before industrials, the testing machines we can buy are not
adapted to our objectives and we have to develop our own softwares to improve
our tests.

This is the original reason why we created Crappy : provide a framework to 
control our tests and all of our hardware.

To this end, we made some choice that are now the keys of the framework:

- **open-source** : it is important for us that everyone can use our work, 
and bring is own code to the world.
    
- **modular** : the hardware as to be, as much as possible, separated from the
software, to provide re-usable code for different setup.
    
- **simple** : Python as been chosen for its good performance and its high 
level. We are not developpers, and our users neither, so we can't afford
a low level programming language. We work with typical loop time of more 
than 1 millisecond (10ms most of the time), and Python is enough for this.
It is also pretty easy to put a small piece of C/C++ in the Python if we 
need a speedup.

- **performance** : a great deal of work is made to ensure the performance of 
the framework. Most tests requires a good repetablilty and a stability,
and may become hazardous in case of not-handled issue.

- **parallelization** : the key to a good test is the synchronisation between
the different sensors. Thsi is why we chose to massively parallelize our
framework, to ensure everything can run at the same time. This is also one
of the major difficulties we have to deal with in Python.

/*! \page physical_objects Physical objects

As Crappy is originaly designed to control tests, the core of our framework
is the hardware we work with.

We chose to divide it in three different categories.

Sensors
-------
In Crappy, the sensors represent everything that can **acquire** a physical
signal. It can be an acquisition card, but also a camera, a thermocouple...

Actuators
---------
on the other hand, actuators represent all the objects that can **interact on
the other part of the test**, and can be controled. The most common example are 
motors.

Technicals
----------
Some hardware is **both a sensor and an actuator** by our definitions. This is for 
example the case of a variable-frequency drive : they can set the speed of the
motor (the *actuator* part), but most of them can also read the position or the
speed of the motor the *sensor* part).

*/

/*! \page blocks Blocks objects

Crappy is based on a schematic architecture with single blocks linked between
each others. Th blocks are the part that **do** and the *Links* are the parts 
that carry informations between these blocks.

This way, you can simply write down on a paper the architecture of your test,
what functions you need in which order, and write your code by reading your 
paper.

## add a schema here

Blocks are classes, running indefinitely in a single process. Some of them are
already implemented (see the reference manual), but you can also implement your
own.
*/


/*! \page links Links objects

Links are simply the part that carry information between the different blocks.
You just need to define the input and the output of a links, and it will 
transfer all data from one block to the other.
*/

/*! \page  condition Condition objects

With the Blocks and Links, we already have a working framework to design and 
custom tests. But if you need to do something slightly different than what is 
implemented in the Blocks, you have to re-write the whole thing.

To bring some flexibility to the whole system, we added conditions. They are 
small classes, implemented by the user, and they are added on the links.
A link paired with a condition won't simply transfer data, but transfer the 
result of the data passed by the condition.
That mean almost infinite possibilites :

- Modify the values you are passing
- Evaluate a composition of the values
- Decide wether you should transfer - or not - the data
- Transfer something completely different from the input values

This can be used to send a signal to another block (for example to synchronise 
a camera), filter the signal with a mean, include numerical modelisation in 
real-time in your test...
